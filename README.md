# HKR News

Welcome to HKR News, the _slightly_ better and _barely_ more beautiful version of the popular news site Hacker News. Because let's be real, the original design was just too much to handle.

## TODO

-   Implement New, Threads, Past, Comments, Ask, Show, Jobs, Submit, and Login. (If possible)
-   Implement a better design for the comments section. (Like discord kinda)
-   Implement Partytown to make the website faster.

## API

We utilize the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to retrieve the latest stories and comments from Hacker News. Because, why not? Might as well use something that already exists.

## Live Website

Check out our live website at [https://alexxycarlsson.github.io/hkrnews/](https://alexxycarlsson.github.io/hkrnews/) to see our implementation in action. Or don't, it's not like it's anything groundbreaking.

## Feedback

We welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvements. Please feel free to open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexxycarlsson/hkrnews) or contact us directly. But let's be honest, you're probably not going to.

Thank you for using HKR News! Or not, your call.
